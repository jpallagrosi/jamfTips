inception.sh

If you are an Apple Jamf admin, it is likely that you have built workflows involving a script that is triggered by a LaunchAgent or at least heard of it.

Every time I make one it always takes some time to get the script ready then having to build the workflow THEN the script to deploy it.

The inception script will help you build the deployment script of the workflow to trigger your script. Or at least a first draft so you can tweak it should you need it.

A script within a script within a script.

Instructions:

1 Script to be deployed - Build your script and save it on your device.

2 A dream within a dream - Run inception.sh as sudo

3 Naming all items - You’ll be prompt for 3 names: 
- The name of the deployment script. The one that you will upload in Jamf.
- The name of your script.
- The name of the Launch Agent or Daemon. I recommend using the same name as the popup script to keep the workflow consistent.

4 Locations - You’ll be prompt for 3 paths:
- The path to your script.
- The path to the location where you want to deploy it. /Library/Scripts/ is the default answer.
- The path to the location where you want the deployment script to be printed. /Users/Shared/ is the default answer.

5 Depending on your workflow, chose Launch Agent or Daemon.

Once you have gone through the process, the deployment script will be in the the shared folder (if you have not changed its location) 
It is executable so I recommend testing it locally. Tweak it if needed. 
NOTE the launch agent will work but it is basic so you may want to add options to be more suitable with what is needed.

When you are happy with it you can upload it in Jamf and scope it to the Macs.

NOTE for OS13+ deployment. The LaunchAgent and script will trigger a notification at installation.
It is nicer for the end user to also deploy a configuration profile for the Login Item. 
This will suppress the notification.
